## üìñ Overview

This Terraform configuration automates the setup of a secure VPC environment on Alibaba Cloud. It creates the following components:

- A VPC with an external and internal VSwitch.
- Security groups with rules for both ingress and egress traffic.
- Route tables and entries for traffic routing.
- A FortiGate instance with 2x ENIs (Elastic Network Interface).
- User data configuration for FortiGate initial setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

coming soon

## ‚úÖ Pre-requisites

- Terraform installed (version >= 1.0)
- Alibaba Cloud account with API credentials configured
- FortiGate image ID and license details
- Valid Alibaba Cloud Access Key and Secret Key
- Properly configured terraform.tfvars file

## üìù Configuration

Create a terraform.tfvars file to specify your configuration. You can check "terraform.tfvars.example" for guidance.

## üöÄ Usage

Follow these steps to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:

### 1. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize the Terraform environment:

```bash
terraform init
```
### 2. Plan the Deployment

Review the changes that Terraform will make without applying them yet:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 3. Apply the Configuration

Deploy the infrastructure with:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

The -auto-approve flag automatically approves the changes, so you don't have to confirm them manually.

## üì¶ Resources Created

This Terraform configuration creates the following Alibaba Cloud resources:

- VPC: A new VPC with a specified CIDR block.
- VSwitches: External and internal VSwitches for network segmentation.
- Security Groups: Rules for allowing all ingress and egress TCP traffic.
- Route Table: A route table with a default route pointing to the FortiGate instance.
- FortiGate Instance: A FortiGate-VM instance with attached ENIs for inspecting traffic.
- ENI: 2x Elastic Network Interfaces attached to the FortiGate for internal and external network traffic.
